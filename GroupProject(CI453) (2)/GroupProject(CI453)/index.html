        <p>In this section of the website we are going to be talking about different malware types like ransomware,trojans,adware,spyware and more. We are also going to be talking about different mitigation strategies that can be used to stop and prevent any of these from happening to you.</p>

        <h3>Ransomware</h3>
        <p>Disables victims access to data until ransom is paid, generally threatening to erase or publish the data that is being held, the primary issue that follows these threats is that the data may still remain inaccessible to the user after the requested ransom has been paid.<br>
          Mitigation: Regular backup of data and have caution with software being allowed on your network, use of multiple strong passwords for different software additionally to help with keeping up with multiple complex passwords, password managers can be used.

        <h3>Fileless Malware</h3>
        <p>Makes changes to files that are native to the OS, doesn't have to install code to launch fileless malware attack, once gaining access they can use native tools that are pre-installed such as powershell to help them conduct their attack. These can come in many forms that can lead to other types of malware attacks, these generally are initiated through the use of phishing emails or social media, by using the software already installed it makes them hard to initially detect. Also other primary issue with these types of attack is once they have been initiated they can modify the registry to allow themselves to create a backdoor to gain access again without having to go through the first steps of gaining access.<br>
          The primary defence against fileless malware is disabling powershell and WMI when they aren't being used. For example: Astaroth.

        <h3>Spyware</h3>
        <p>Collects user activity data without their knowledge
          While being a loose term spyware is essentially a software that is installed to gather data from you and your device and then forward it to a third party
          The data it can collect can range from the websites you visit and things you've downloaded to much more confidential data such as usernames and passwords which can further compromise accounts alongside your device
          Spyware can be installed in sneaky ways such as through agreeing to terms and services of legitimate looking software that you've installed and even through uninstalling said software will not remove it
          To remove spyware it is best to install software such as AVG or Mcaffe which is known for spyware removal
          Prevention however can be done through the use of care when installing software from unsafe sites or unreliable sources. Alongside this phishing much like other malware is common for infection, being careful when accessing emails from unknown sources and being careful when clicking on unknown site links.
          Example: DarkHotel</p>

      <div class="content">

        <h3>Adware</h3>
        <p>Adware is software that is designed to pop-up on the user's device and provide unwanted advertisements.
          It is generally installed onto a computer through disguising itself as a legitimate program or through “Piggy backing” off another program both of which once installed run in the background
          This program can either have pre-loaded ad's that aren't designed specifically for the user, however many will track location alongside sites that have been visited to present more targeted ads making them more enticing for to be clicked on
          The key signs that Adware has been installed on your device are of course ads popping up when they shouldn't be however there are other indicators such as web browser homepage changes, new extensions and plugins within your browser or the slowing of your browser.
          Removal of Adware the best option is through the use of cybersecurity software such as AVG or Mcaffe
          To avoid getting Adware on your device in the first place, it's best to be wary of installing software off sites that you don't know or installing any kind of free software and ensuring that you read terms of service before agreeing to any terms and conditions.
          Example: Fireball
          
          </p>



      </div>

     



    </div>

    <div class="row">

      


      <div class="content">

        <h3>Trojans</h3>
        <p>Trojans named after the story of the Trojan horse gain access into computers through the use of malicious spam emails, generally by attaching files that automatically download when the email is opened
          After the software is downloaded onto the users device it will run every time that the computer is booted.
          Not all Trojans are the same, with many acting in different ways from one another. A primary example is a backdoor Trojan which provides backdoor access to the device allowing remote access to a third-party working similarly to spyware
          Much like malware the best way to avoid getting a Trojan on your device is to be careful when opening emails with suspicious attachments. One of the most dangerous thing about a trojan is that once infecting a computer the third-party can use the computer itself to send emails from the users account meaning that sometimes you could even receive.
          Example: Emotet
          </p>

        <h3>Worms</h3>
        <p>Spreads through a network by replicating itself
          Acts as a standalone program that doesn't target or infect specific files rather it targets the OS of the computer manipulating or deleting files while replicating itself on loop draining the computer by using up storage and memory. Additionally it can also inject further malicious content
          It primarily spreads over a network such as through emails and messages disguised as a legitimate file which initiates itself once it's downloaded and begins the attack
          The best way to avoid.
          Example: Stuxnet
          
          
          </p>



      </div>

      <div class="content">

        <h3>KeyLoggers</h3>
        <p>Keyloggers as the name implies, log the keystrokes of the user and creates a file that is sent to the person who installed the key logger
          Keyloggers can be physical and in this case can usually be found within the USB port which makes it easy to locate and detect.
          Example: Olympic Visions
          
          </p>

        <h3>External Threats</h3>
        <p>In our modern-day society in which almost every person has one or more personal device, it is becoming increasingly important to be aware of the potential threats and attacks you could face while online. One key piece to cyber security is to distinguish the difference between internal and external threats.
External threats are designed by someone with the intention of causing harm or compromising a users data. These can come in many different ways such as: Phishing, Malware and DDOS attacks. While these aren’t all the forms that an external threat might manifest they generally all are designed to gain access to the users device without the user knowing and collect or manipulate the users data and are the most common threat that you are likely to face, far more common that that of internal threats</p>

    </div>




    <div class="row">

      

      


      <div class="content">

        <h3>Internal Threats</h3>
        <p>Internal threats unlike external threats are the result of someone who already has access to the system compromising data. This generally comes from current or former employees of a company, and more often than not is accidental with data leaks or deleting sensitive and important data.
Most of the accidental issues can be resolved prior to their occurrence through a brief cyber security course alongside privilege restrictions on files which would not be required depending on the role within the company. These steps can also help to protect against those with malicious intent however it is also recommended that the system goes through some level of penetration testing alongside endpoint monitoring to help detect any strange behaviour.

        <h3>Legal And Ethical Issues</h3>
        <p>Ethical issues in cyber security: Ethics within the world of computing is generally what separates security personnel from hackers, similar to how in day to day life the ethics of someone’s choices and knowledge of what’s wrong from right differentiates between police and a criminal.
The data that is generally targeted in an attack is highly sensitive and can be extremely damaging to either a company or an individual so protection of this data is extremely critical. On this basis, within a company when hiring individuals there should be a display of ethics and once hired the standard should be maintained when handling customer data.
